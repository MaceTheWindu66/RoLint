## Python rules to be implemented:
#      - Static type checking (requiring type hints on variables)
#      - Ban unsafe python functions
#      - Enforce safe threading practices (i.e Graceful Termination)
#      - Enforce PEP8 standards
#      - Enforce runtime assertions (with prebuilt template function rather than assert)
#      -
